- Why does `LinkedStack` not require an explicit constructor?  
An explicit constructor is not needed because with a LinkedList, the nodes are added individually and
with this class LinkedStack, the interface has already been implemented.

- What is the time and (extra) space complexity of each of the `LinkedStack` methods, as well as `ReverseLines.main`?
- How else (not using `Node`) could we have implemented `LinkedStack` in such a way that it is still based on a linked list but the `asList` method uses constant time and space?
- Is it better for `push` and `pop` to return the item or the stack itself?
- Briefly discuss the pros and cons of each design.
